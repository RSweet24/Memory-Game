## Instructions

In case you are not familiar with the Memory Game, The point of the game is to match all of the cards on the Game Board.

You may only turn over 2 cards at a time, If the cards do not match the game board will shake. When they do match they will flip and change to green. A timer will start as soon as the first card is clicked and the more moves it takes you the less stars you get. At the end of the game a modal will appear with your final score and time and star number.

Enjoy the game!
